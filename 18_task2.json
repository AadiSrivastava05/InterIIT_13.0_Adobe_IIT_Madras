            "Excessive sharpness in certain image regions": "The truck's edges and contours appear unnaturally crisp and defined, creating a stark contrast with the softer background elements. This excessive sharpness gives the vehicle an almost artificial appearance, as if it has been digitally enhanced or rendered.",
            "Unnaturally glossy surfaces": "The truck's surface appears unnaturally shiny and reflective, creating an unrealistic appearance against the background.",
            "Artificial noise patterns in uniform surfaces": "Artificial noise patterns are visible in uniform surfaces, particularly noticeable in the sky and the building in the background.

            "Non-manifold geometries in rigid structures": "The image shows a car with an unusual, distorted shape. The vehicle's body appears to have irregular contours and unusual angles, deviating from the typical smooth lines of a standard automobile.",
            "Asymmetric features in naturally symmetric objects": "The car's wheels are noticeably different sizes, with the front wheel appearing significantly larger than the rear one. This asymmetry is unusual for a vehicle and creates an odd visual effect.",
            "Irregular proportions in mechanical components": "The car's mechanical components, particularly the wheels and body, appear distorted and disproportionate. The front wheel is unusually large compared to the car's size, and the body has an odd, elongated shape that doesn't match typical car designs.",
            "Inconsistent scale of mechanical parts": "The car's proportions are severely distorted, with an unusually large front section and disproportionately small rear. This inconsistent scale makes the vehicle appear unrealistic and surreal.",
            "Incorrect perspective rendering": "The car appears to be floating above the road due to an incorrect perspective rendering, creating an unrealistic and disorienting visual effect.",
            "Spatial relationship errors": "The car's wheels are disproportionately large compared to its body, creating an unrealistic spatial relationship between the vehicle's components.",
            "Depth perception anomalies": "The image exhibits significant depth perception anomalies, with the car appearing to be unnaturally close to the camera. This results in an exaggerated sense of scale, making the vehicle seem disproportionately large compared to its surroundings.",
            "Excessive sharpness in certain image regions": "The image exhibits excessive sharpness in certain regions, particularly around the car's wheels and edges. This sharpness creates an unnatural contrast with the overall blurry and pixelated appearance of the scene, making these areas stand out and appear almost drawn rather than photographed.",
            "Fake depth of field": "The image exhibits an unnatural depth of field effect, where the car appears sharply focused while the background is unnaturally blurred. This effect is likely caused by AI-generated artifacts, creating an unrealistic contrast between the foreground and background elements.",
            "Artificial depth of field in object presentation": "The image exhibits an unusual depth effect, with the car appearing to have a different focus than its surroundings. This creates an artificial depth of field, making the vehicle stand out from the background in an unnatural way.",
            "Unnaturally glossy surfaces": "The car's surfaces appear unnaturally smooth and reflective, lacking the texture and imperfections typically seen in real-world vehicles.",
            "Texture bleeding between adjacent regions": "The image shows a significant texture bleeding artifact where the white areas of the car and background blend together, creating an unnatural transition between different regions of the image.",
            "Over-smoothing of natural textures": "The image exhibits excessive smoothing of natural textures, resulting in a loss of detail and depth. This over-smoothing affects various elements, including the car's body, the road surface, and the surrounding environment, creating a blurred and artificial appearance.",
            "Artificial noise patterns in uniform surfaces": "Artificial noise patterns are visible in uniform surfaces, particularly in the road markings and background areas. These patterns appear as grainy or pixelated artifacts, creating an unrealistic texture in what should be smooth areas of the image.",
            "Repeated element patterns": "The image shows repeated patterns of small black dots scattered across the entire scene, creating a pixelated or glitch-like effect that obscures the details of the car and surroundings.",
            "Systematic color distribution anomalies": "The image exhibits systematic color distribution anomalies, where the entire scene appears to be uniformly distorted. This results in a consistent shift in color tones across the photograph, affecting the overall visual representation of the scene.",
            "Artificial smoothness": "The image exhibits artificial smoothness, particularly in the car's body and surroundings. This effect creates an unrealistic, overly polished appearance that contrasts with the expected textures and details in a photograph.",

            "Anatomically incorrect paw structures": "The dog's front paws are missing toes, and the back right paw appears to be missing entirely. These anatomical inconsistencies are typical of AI-generated images that struggle with accurately rendering complex structures like animal paws.",
            "Unnatural pose artifacts": "The dog's legs appear unnaturally positioned, with an unnatural gap between the front and back legs on the right side. This creates an unrealistic appearance, as dogs typically have more natural alignment of their limbs.",

            "Misaligned bilateral elements in animal faces": "The dog's legs appear to be in an unnatural position, with the back legs not aligned correctly and the front legs positioned awkwardly. This misalignment creates an unrealistic appearance of the animal's body structure.",
            "Incorrect perspective rendering": "The dog's proportions are distorted, with an unusually long body and short legs, creating an unnatural perspective.",
            "Spatial relationship errors": "The dog's legs are shown in an impossible position, with the front legs appearing to be on the same side of its body, which is anatomically incorrect for a walking dog.",
            "Depth perception anomalies": "The dog's legs appear disproportionately long compared to its body, creating an unnatural depth perception effect.",
            "Excessive sharpness in certain image regions": "The image exhibits excessive sharpness in certain regions, particularly around the dog's legs and body edges. This sharpness creates an unnatural, almost artificial appearance, contrasting with the softer areas of the image such as the grass. The excessive detail in these areas gives the impression of over-processing or digital enhancement.",
            "Fake depth of field": "The image exhibits an unnatural depth of field effect, where the dog appears to be in sharp focus while the background is unnaturally blurred. This effect is likely caused by digital manipulation or an inappropriate camera setting, creating an unrealistic separation between the subject and its surroundings.",
            "Artificial depth of field in object presentation": "The image exhibits an unusual depth effect, with the dog appearing to have a blurred or unfocused appearance while the background remains sharp.
